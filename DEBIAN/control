Description: Elegant and simple dock.
 Plank Reloaded is a fork of the original Plank project, providing a simple dock
 for X11 desktop environments. While development began with a focus on Cinnamon,
 we now actively support multiple desktop environments including MATE and Xfce.
 Like its predecessor, Plank Reloaded aims to be the simplest dock on the
 planet, providing just what a dock needs and absolutely nothing more.
