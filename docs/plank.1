plank \- elegant and simple dock
.SH DESCRIPTION
Plank Reloaded is a fork of the original Plank project, focusing on Cinnamon
desktop compatibility and modernized features. Like its predecessor, it aims
to be the simplest dock on the planet, providing just what a dock needs and
absolutely nothing more. It remains a library which can be extended to create
other dock programs with more advanced features.
